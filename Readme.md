# Data Entry Templates for Global Ocean Observing System Macroalgal EOV Visual SOP

The files here are for taking data in the field and entering it using the GOOS Essential Ocean Variable visual macroalgal protocols. Contained in the folder are the following:

### Taking Data and Data Entry

1. Data sheets for intertidal or subtidal fieldwork in the `data sheets for fieldwork` folder.

2. Forms that you will need to fill out to describe your sampling program (Administrative info, protocol descriptor which is pre-filled out with the GOOS protocol information, and a species list).

3. Data entry forms for either the intertidal or subtidal for the GOOS protocol.

4. Example filled out datasets from three different sampling programs using these forms.

### Creating GOOS Macroalgal EOV Compatible Datasets

We also include R script files in the `scripts` folder for both the intertidal and subtidal example data sets. These scripts take the collection of metadata forms (admin, protocol descriptor, and species list) along with the data and combine them into EOV compliant clean data sets found in the `example clean datasets` folder. These scripts can readily be adapted for how you setup your program's data workflow before submitting the data to [Temperate Reefbase](https://temperatereefbase.imas.utas.edu.au/static/landing.html) and on into [OBIS](https://obis.org/).
